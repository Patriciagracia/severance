# Severance - Macrodata Refinement
Hi, kids. What's for dinner? üëãüèª
This project recreates the Macrodata Refinement software from Severance, the Apple TV+ series, simulating the eerie and mysterious data-sorting experience seen in the show. I built it just for fun, and there's room for improvement‚Äîit would be interesting to add interactions to engage the user and to fix the number animations, which are currently hardcoded.
